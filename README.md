# Electric-Vehicle-Population-Analysis-Using-SAS
This project analyzes electric vehicle data in SAS to identify which legislative district has the newest cars and to compare electric range between BEVs and PHEVs. Descriptive stats, plots, and a two-sample t-test show that District 11 has the newest cars and that BEVs have significantly higher range.
